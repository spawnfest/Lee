#+TITLE: Lee

* User stories

- As a power user I want to configure tools without looking into their
  code. I want a useful error message instead of a BEAM dump when I
  make an error in the config. I want documentation about all
  configurable parameters, their purpose and type.

- As a designer I want to develop the tool instead of dealing with
  the boring configuration-related stuff.

There are few approaches to this conflict:

* Explanation

/Lee/ helps creating type-safe, self-documenting configuration for
Erlang applications. It is basically a data modeling DSL, vaguely
inspired by [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7950][YANG]], however scaled down /a lot/.

Software configuration is a solved problem. The solution is to gather
all the information about user-facing commands and parameters in one
place called /data model/ and generate all kinds of code and
documentation from it, instead of spending a lot of time trying to
keep it in sync with the documentation and failing in this.

Unfortunately, the existing data modeling solutions are extremely
heavy and nasty to deal with. One doesn't want to mess with YANG
compilers and proprietary libraries for a mere small tool, and it's
understandable. /Lee/ attempts to implement a /reasonably useful/ data
modeling DSL, some bare-bones libraries for CLI and config file
parsing, together with the model validation routines in under 3000 LOC
or so.

* Name?

This library is named after Tsung-Dao Lee, a physicist who predicted
P-symmetry violation together with Chen-Ning Yang.
